## 💼 Featured Projects

### 1. 🧠 Data Modeling with MS SQL Server — *Case Study: Medical Reality Shows*

In this project, I designed a complete physical database model to capture data about medical reality shows. The scenario involved:

- Recording show name, genre, participants (each show with 2+ participants)
- Producers (one-to-one with shows), TV stations (each can air multiple shows)
- End-users who rate shows (scores 0–20)
  
**Deliverables:**
- Physical data model
- SQL schema creation
- ER Diagram with proper entities, keys, attributes, and relationships
